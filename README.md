This is the research and development repository related to my teaching in the [Academy of Visual Arts](https://ava.hkbu.edu.hk), HKBU, using the [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/) software. Majority of the code will be tutorials covering the use of various Python libraries within TouchDesigner.
