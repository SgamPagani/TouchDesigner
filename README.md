# TouchDesigner
This is the research and development repository related to my teaching in the [Academy of Visual Arts](https://ava.hkbu.edu.hk), HKBU, using the [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/) software. Majority of the code will be tutorials covering the use of various Python libraries within TouchDesigner.


[TestScriptTOP](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2021/05/24/script-top-in-touchdesigner/) - an introduction to the use of Script TOP with basic pass through of video device input to the output window.

[ScriptTOPCanny](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2021/05/24/script-top-in-touchdesigner-canny/) - a demonstration of Script TOP with the cv2.Canny function for edge detecion.

[MediaPipeFaceDetection](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2021/05/24/mediapipe-in-touchdesigner-2/) - an example of using the MediaPipe face detection and drawing function.

[FaceDetectionScriptCHOP](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2021/05/24/mediapipe-in-touchdesigner-3/) - a functional prototype using MediaPipe for face detection in TouchDesigner.

[MediaPipeFaceMeshTOP](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2021/05/31/mediapipe-in-touchdesigner-4/) - a demonstration of the Face Mesh function in the MediaPipe solutions.

[MediaPipeFaceMeshSOP](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2021/05/31/mediapipe-in-touchdesigner-5/) - a more advanced version of the Face Mesh example. It will generate a 3D mesh from a Script SOP using the face mesh data from the MediaPipe soluitons.

[MediaPipeHandTOP](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2021/06/02/mediapipe-in-touchdesigner-6/) - a simple demonstration of the hand tracking solution from MediaPipe with the display in a Script TOP.

[MediaPipeHandCHOP](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2021/06/02/mediapipe-in-touchdesigner-7/) - an example to extract the hand tracking details in a Script CHOP. It only uses the Index Finger Tip for interaction design.

[MediaPipeHandCHOP2]() - another example to expose all the finger details in a Script CHOP. It aligns the circle TOP to each of the finger tip.
